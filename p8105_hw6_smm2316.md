### Problem 1

``` r
birthweight = read_csv("./data/birthweight.csv")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

``` r
birthweight = 
  birthweight %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate(
    babysex = factor(babysex),
    babysex = recode(babysex, "1" = "male", "2" = "female"),
    frace = factor (frace),
    frace = recode(frace, "1" = "white", "2" = "black", "3" = "asian", "4" = "puerto rican", "8" = "other", "9" = "unkown"),
    malform = factor(malform), 
    malform = recode(malform, "0" = "absent", "1" = "present"),
    mrace = factor(mrace), 
    mrace = recode(mrace, "1" = "white", "2" = "black", "3" = "asian", "4" = "puerto rican", "8" = "other")
  )
```

``` r
bw_model = lm(bwt ~ gaweeks + blength + fincome + wtgain, data = birthweight)

birthweight %>%
  add_residuals(bw_model) %>%
  add_predictions(bw_model) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid)) +
          geom_point() +
          labs (x = "Prediction", y = "Residual", title = "Residuals by Prediction of Proposed Birthweight Model")
```

``` r
comp_model1 = lm(bwt ~ gaweeks + blength, data = birthweight)
comp_model2 = lm(bwt ~ babysex * blength * bhead, data = birthweight)
