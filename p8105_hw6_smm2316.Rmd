### Problem 1

```{r read and tidy}
birthweight = read_csv("./data/birthweight.csv")

birthweight = 
  birthweight %>%
  remove_missing() %>%
  mutate(
    babysex = factor(babysex),
    babysex = recode(babysex, "1" = "male", "2" = "female"),
    frace = factor (frace),
    frace = recode(frace, "1" = "white", "2" = "black", "3" = "asian", "4" = "puerto rican", "8" = "other", "9" = "unkown"),
    malform = factor(malform), 
    malform = recode(malform, "0" = "absent", "1" = "present"),
    mrace = factor(mrace), 
    mrace = recode(mrace, "1" = "white", "2" = "black", "3" = "asian", "4" = "puerto rican", "8" = "other")
  )
```
